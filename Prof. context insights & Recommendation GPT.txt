The highest attrition occurs in the 26-35 age group, which represents a critical phase in employees' careers where they seek better opportunities for career advancement and financial growth. Additionally, employees in the 18-45 age range are more likely to switch jobs, suggesting the importance of targeted retention strategies for early to mid-career professionals.
